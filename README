== wazu

Wazu is a distributed job manager.

== wazu cron

  First, connect to the wazu cron DRB server :
    @wc = DRbObject.new nil, "druby://localhost:6999"

  Second, create a job_info as follows :
    job_info = {"job_id" => job_id, "job_params" => ""}

  Third, submit the job :
    @wc.schedule_job_in("5", job_info)

  This should run the job in 5 seconds.

  To schedule a job using cron syntax :
    @wc.schedule_cron_job("* * * * *", job_info)

  This should run the job every minute as long as the wazu cron is running.

  Note : The previous two remote method calls will run an existing job.

  To schedule a new job immediately :
    @wc.schedule_new_job_now("job command", "job name")

  This should run the job immediately.
